What influences the use of WiFi data on the Downtown mall? Are people more likely to work outside when it's nicer out? If so, what about the weather - high temps, clear skies - has the greatest influence? Or are people more likely to use the WiFi socially, like at an event or while out to dinner? With the WiFi data from the Astrea Open Data challenge we decided to investigate further.

We made a model 

We loaded in weather to look at date, condition, max temp, min temp, and precipitation. 

We compared weather with usage

We made some predictions
